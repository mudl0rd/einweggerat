# einweggerät

## ⚡ This application is discontinued.

Why:
* [Superseded by something using dear-imgui, GL4.6/GLES3, and GCC.](https://mudl0rd.github.io/WTFweg/)
* Would involve extensive rewrites to support modern cores.
* A relic tbh since it was Windows only.

**Support/help/bug reports will be ignored.**
